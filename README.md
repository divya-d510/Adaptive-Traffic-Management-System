## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Adaptive Traffic Control Algorithm

The system uses a density-based adaptive algorithm:

1. **Vehicle Detection**: Count vehicles at each approach
2. **Queue Analysis**: Calculate waiting vehicles
3. **Dynamic Timing**: Adjust green time based on traffic
4. **Phase Switching**: Change signals when optimal

**Formula:**
```
Green Time = BASE_TIME + (vehicle_count × EXTENSION_FACTOR)
Constrained by: MIN_GREEN_TIME ≤ Green Time ≤ MAX_GREEN_TIME
```

### Vehicle Detection Process

1. **Background Subtraction**: Identify moving objects
2. **Morphological Operations**: Clean up noise
3. **Contour Detection**: Find vehicle boundaries
4. **Filtering**: Apply size and aspect ratio constraints
5. **Tracking**: Maintain detection history for stability

### Intersection Simulation

- **Vehicle Spawning**: Based on actual traffic counts
- **Movement**: Realistic speed and acceleration
- **Stop Zones**: Vehicles stop at red lights
- **Clearing**: Vehicles proceed on green
- **Visualization**: Color-coded vehicles with IDs


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
```bash
# Check camera availability
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"

# Try different camera index
# Edit app/config.py: CAMERA_INDEX = 1
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Change port in run.py
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5003)  # Use different port
```

### Video Streams Not Loading
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify system is running: `python run.py`
3. Try refreshing browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. Check firewall allows port 5002

### Slow Performance
- Reduce camera resolution in `app/config.py`
- Lower video quality in `app/api/video_stream.py`
- Close other applications
- Use wired connection instead of WiFi
